            "A":"A: In China, there is an old saying that sums up China’s geographical environment: “Seven mountains, two waters, one field”. This sentence undoubtedly tells the world that China is a big stone producing country. In fact, many stone types produced in China are already popular in the American tombstone market. Tombstones are definitely a durable and permanent outdoor product, so the processing of tombstones requires a lot of expertise and processing procedures.

The three types of granite that are popular in the market are: grey stone; red stone; black stone. Grey stone is cheap and good quality, and has a traditional outlook, so it is the choice of many Chinese compatriots. There are also many people who love redstone, and Indian red is the first choice among redstones. Among blackstones, Indian blackstones are world-famous, but now Chinese blackstones have become popular in the United States. Other common stone species include Fujian blue, Bahamian blue, opal, and so on. Yonglong’s stele showroom has a variety of samples on display, and family members are welcome to visit and order."

Due to the different regulations of each cemetery, family members should provide the information of the cemetery when inquiring. 2. Except for conventional tombstones whose price is relatively stable due to their fixed size, for all other tombstones, family members must provide information on the size of the tombstone and the location of the cemetery before quoting.

            "A":"A: Traditionally, the Chinese believe that tombstones are the century-old heritage of future generations, and that carelessness will bring disaster to future generations. So it is very important to have some knowledge in this area. When making Chinese tombstones, pay attention to the following issues. One, font selection and processing. The font is selected appropriately, engraved on granite, and the effect is stable Built and deep, the taste deepens over the years. In the process of engraving, computer samples often change the font slightly, and the distortion is regrettable. Masters with Chinese roots can correct the blind spots of computers in the engraving process. Second, the choice of pattern. Choose a tombstone pattern and be full of business. If the tree is selected, it must have leaves, stems and rhizomes. Choose bamboo trees and bamboos to report safety and rise steadily. In addition, pine cranes, lions, lotus flowers, roses, winter plums, and monarch orchid are all good design choices. Third, the stone carving process. Stone carving is a specialized craft, and the lettering techniques include concave characters, convex characters, lace and so on. Pattern processing line engraving, deep engraving. The surface treatment is polished, sanded, natural grain, and so on. Different designs have different process applications. Fourth, portraits. When making portraits, pay attention to choosing durable materials. The porcelain phase produced by Yonglong is fired according to the traditional ancient method and will never fade. In addition, Yonglong also has high attainments in black stone shadow sculpture portraits."
